## Description

The **Vibe Social** website was developed as part of a course assignment in JavaScript 2. The goal was to build the front-end for a social media application, using Noroffs social API, and all it's endpoints. Other requirements included making use of ES6 modules and adding JsDocs to at least three functions.

The website includes the following pages:

- **Home** - Main page where user can go to login or register.
- **Login** - Where the user can login to their account.
- **Register** - Where the user can register an account.
- **Feed** â€“ Where the user can either view all, view following, view their own, or search through posts. Users can click on each post to view it as an overlay, or click the author image on each post to go to that authors profile.
- **Edit Post** - Where the user can either edit or delete a post.
- **Create Post** - Where the user can create a new post.
- **Profile** - Showcasing key information on either the users own account, or other accounts.
- **Edit Profile** - Where the user can edit their own account information.
